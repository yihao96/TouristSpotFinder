# TouristSpotFinder
An Android app for finding tourist spots

This is an assignment for Advanced Mobile Computing with Android module as a part of my course BSc in Information Technology with specialism in Mobile Technology in Asia Pacific University.

This application was developed using Android Studio 3.3, Firebase, and AndroidX technology. 

The application has 2 parts; 1 for Android app and 1 for web.
